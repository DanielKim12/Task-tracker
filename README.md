## Features

- Add new tasks
- Update existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as "in-progress" or "done"
- List tasks based on their status
- All tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file

## Requirements

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-tracker-cli.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd task-tracker-cli
```

3. Install dependencies (if any) â€” currently, there are no external dependencies, so this step is not necessary unless you add some in the future.
