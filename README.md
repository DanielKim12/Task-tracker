# To-Do App Backend Project

## Overview
This project is aimed at creating a backend for a To-Do application. The primary focus is on practicing and brushing up on backend development skills, API calls, and project management as part of a team effort. As the team lead and project manager, I will guide the development process and ensure that we meet the project milestones.

## Project Goals
- Build a scalable and efficient backend for a To-Do application.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for tasks.
- Develop API endpoints that allow clients to interact with the application.
- Practice API documentation and testing.
- Strengthen backend skills including database management, routing, and error handling.
- Collaborate using Git for version control and project management.

## Features
- User authentication and authorization.
- Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Categorize tasks by priority or deadline.
- Assign due dates to tasks.
- Return filtered lists of tasks based on their status (completed, pending).
- Pagination for large task lists.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: Backend framework for building server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: For routing and handling API requests.
- **MongoDB** (or SQL alternative): Database for storing tasks and user data.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens): For secure authentication and authorization.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Postman**: For API testing and documentation.
